# Supervision Guidelines

## Rules of engagement

There are a few simple rules that every supervised student is expected to follow.

### Meetings

  * Meetings are held at regular (usually weekly) intervals that are agreed at the beginning of the semester.
  * The preferred way of meeting is face-to-face (excepting cases of illness or restrictions).
  * If you want to meet outside the regular slot, you need to make an appointment via email. Due to a busy schedule, if you drop in unannounced, you should expect to be turned away.
  * Show up on time and be mindful of the allocated meeting time.
  * You need to come to the meetings preparred with an agenda and keep notes (see below).
  * If you need to cancel the meeting, that's fine. Cancelling the meeting more than three times during the semester (excepting cases of illness) means you resign from the project effective immediately.
  * You are required to prepare a project plan and get it approved from the supervisors as soon as possible. 
  

### Main activities

A thesis project involves three main type of activities:

  * Coding: Writing code, generating data, and running experiments.
  * Reading: Reading both scientific papers and technical documentation.
  * Writing: Editing your thesis (adding, editing, and removing text).

During different periods, some activities will be more pronounced than others (e.g., more reading in the beginning and mostly writing in the last two weeks leading to the delivery deadline). However, generally speaking, you want to do all three, every week.

### Agenda and notes

  * At the beginning of the semester, set up a Google document for keeping notes, by instantiating [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXrqKV7CYZxWgo4pQ6a7bW9CB78yH-Xf1vTLBJiDFUE/edit?usp=sharing) and sharing it with your supervisor(s).
  * Prepare an agenda for the meeting. It ensures that the meeting has a clear purpose.
    - If you don't have an agenda at the beginning of the meeting, then the meeting is over.
    - Failing to prepare an agenda more than three times during the semester essentially means cancelling those meetings and thus amounts to your resignation from the project.
  * The agenda should be structured as follows:
    1. Progress update from last week:
       - Prefix each item with one of "[coding]", "[reading]", or "[writing]".
    2. Questions/blockers: 
       - These are critical issues that are holding you back and would need help with.
    3. Discussion notes: 
       - Initialize this section with a list of (non-critical) things that you want to discuss during the meeting.
       - Your notes taken during the meeting will also come here.
    4. Action items:
       - These are your TODOs for the next week. Prefix each item with one of "[coding]", "[reading]", or "[writing]".
       - There may also be TODOs for your supervisor. Prefix them with their initials, e.g., "[KB]".
  * If there are items that need preparation from the supervisor's end before the meeting, i.e., the questions/blockers block is not empty, make sure you share the agenda at least 24 hours before the meeting (by emailing the link to your Google document).

### Supervisor roles and responsibilities 
* Each thesis group has a course coordinator (fagligansvarlig) and a supervisor. 
* The supervisor can be internal if the thesis work is carried out at the UiS or external if the thesis work is carried out at an external company.
* Course coordinator and internal supervisor can be different people in case PhD students are the internal supervisors.
* Course coordinator:
  - Approve the level and scope of the project
  - Sign a contract with the students before formal registration
  - Approve the progress plan for the work
  - Students are entitled to at least five meetings with the course coordinator throughout the semester.
* Internal supervisors:
  - Frequently meetings during the semester. Minimum one meeting every second week.
  - Require a project plan from the students
  - Require that students prepare for the meetings and that they show progression during the semester
 * The student has to agree on specific supervison rules with the external supervisor in case of thesis work carried out at an external company.

### Thesis

The thesis is your main deliverable and should be your #1 priority!

*(Further information on thesis writing -structure, milestones, resources- will be added here.)*

  * Follow the [IAI Scientific Writing Guidelines](https://github.com/iai-group/guidelines/tree/main/writing).
  
  * Use the following templates for writing your thesis. You may either use the overleaf template or the github repo. Optionally you can sync them both.
    - BSc thesis template [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vqcfdjzmcnsm), [GitHub](https://github.com/iai-group/template-thesis-bsc)
    - MSc thesis template [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mtmtjzbtbwbm), [GitHub](https://github.com/iai-group/template-thesis-msc)

### Coding

The code (and generated data/results) are the secondary deliverables. You should aim for making it publicly releasable on GitHub.

  * We adhere to the [IAI Guidelines](https://github.com/iai-group/guidelines).
