# Templates for article abstract

## Template 1

  * Motivation: Why do we care about the problem and the results?
  * Problem statement: What problem are you trying to solve?
  * Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product?
  * Results: What's the answer?
  * Conclusions: What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (all of the previous results are useful)?

## Template 2

  * What's the problem and why should I care?
  * What's the state of the art, and what's wrong with it?
  * What's the solution and how does it make intuitive sense?  
  * What's the unique contribution?
