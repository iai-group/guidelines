# IAI reStructuredText Style Guide

## Naming conventions

  * Files names are lowercased and `_` -separated (e.g., `writing_style.rst`).

## Headings

  * Each file should start with a section heading block (`=`) on line 1.
  * The heading marker character line should be the same length as the heading text.
  * There should be an empty line before and after header blocks.
    - The only exception to this rule is the heading on line 1 of a file.

```rst
This is the main title
======================

This is the subtitle
--------------------

This is the subsubtitle
""""""""""""""""""""

This is the subsubsubtitle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

## Lists

  * Top-level lists are marked by `*`, second, third, etc. levels below are marked by `-`.
  * Non top-level items are indented by 2 spaces.
  * Nested lists items have to be separated from the top-level list items by blank lines.

```rst
* List item 1
* List item 2

  - Sub item 21

    - Sub item 211

  - Sub item 22

* List item 3
```
