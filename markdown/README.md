# IAI Markdown Style Guide

## Naming conventions

  * README files are to be named all-caps `README.md`.
  * Other files names are capitalized (i.e., first letter of a word in uppercase, and the rest of the letters in lowercase) and `_` -separated (e.g., `Writing_style.md`).

## Headings

  * Each file should start with a H1 heading (`#`) on line 1
  * There should be an empty line before and after headers.
    - The only exception to this rule is the heading on line 1 of a file.

## Lists

  * Top-level lists are marked by `*`, the second is marked by `-`, third and all levels below are marked by `+`.
  * Indent items, including the top level, with 2 spaces.

```Markdown
  * List item 1
  * List item 2
    - Sub item 21
      + Sub item 211
    - Sub item 22
  * List item 3
```
