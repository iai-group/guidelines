# IAI Markdown Style Guide

## Naming conventions

  * README files are to be named all-caps `README.md`.
  * Other files names are capitalized (i.e., first letter of a word in uppercase, and the rest of the letters in lowercase) and `_` -separated (e.g., `Writing_style.md`).

## Spacing

  * There should be an empty line before and after headers.
    - The only exception to this rule is the heading on line 1 of a file.

## Markup

  * Top-level lists are marked by `*`, second, third, etc. levels below are marked by `-`. 
  * Indent items with 2 spaces.

```
  * List item 1
  * List item 2
    - Sub item 21
      - Sub item 211
    - Sub item 22
  * List item 3
```
